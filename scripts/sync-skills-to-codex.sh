# sync-skills-to-codex.sh — thiscode
# Expose ThisCode skills (knowledge-manager family etc.) to a Codex CLI agent.
#
# Why: ThisCode is a *Claude Code* plugin (.claude-plugin/) — `/plugin install
# thiscode@thiscode-marketplace` exposes its skills/ to Claude Code. Codex does
# NOT read that. Codex's personal skill scan path is ~/.agents/skills/
# (docs CC↔Codex 1:1 mapping). This script syncs the skill SoT (which stays in
# ThisCode/skills/) into ~/.agents/skills/ so Codex bots can invoke them.
#
# SoT note: ThisCode/skills/ is authoritative. This is a one-way copy
# (ThisCode → ~/.agents/skills). Do not edit the copies.
