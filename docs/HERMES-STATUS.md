# Hermes plugin — status: partial / deferred

> Decision: maintainer, 2026-05-16, option ② (redesign to current structure +
> document deferred — do **not** reconstruct the missing dispatchers).

## TL;DR

The `hermes-plugin/` registers thiscode tools into a Hermes Agent host. Its
**programmatic search/ingest path is deferred**. Use the Claude Code path
(`/search`, `/thiscode:km`, or the skills via an LLM agent) for real work.

## What works (active)

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Plugin registration (`__init__.py`) | ✅ tools/commands/hook register cleanly |
| `session_start_drift_check` | ✅ real — shells out to `scripts/km-version.sh` (exists) |
| `plugin.yaml` metadata / agent-spec aggregation | ✅ |

## What is deferred (and why)

| Piece | State | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `handle_search` / `cmd_search` (`claude_discode_search`) | ⏸️ deferred | needs `skills/search/references/tier-implementations.md.sh` |
| `handle_ingest` / `cmd_km` (`claude_discode_ingest`) | ⏸️ deferred | needs `skills/knowledge-manager-lite/references/extract-and-classify.md.sh` |

**Root cause (verified 2026-05-16, 손석희 cross-validated):** thiscode skills
are **LLM-instruction documents** (`SKILL.md` + `references/*.md`), not
executable shell dispatchers. The literate-bash `*.md.sh` dispatchers the
Hermes handlers shell out to were never vendored to the public repo (they
existed only in a private workspace). A programmatic plugin cannot
byte-identically "run" an LLM-instruction skill, so reconstructing the
dispatchers from a guess was explicitly rejected (reconstruction risk).

## Current behavior (honest, non-failing)

- `handle_search` / `handle_ingest`: if the dispatcher file is absent they
  return a structured **`{"status":"deferred", ...}`** JSON pointing here and
  at the Claude Code path. They never raise (Hermes contract) and never fake a
  result.
- The four shell tests that exercised the dispatchers
  (`tests/test-search-tier4-fallback.sh`, `tests/test-integration-cascade.sh`,
  `tests/dogfood/scenario-1-grep-only.sh`, `tests/test-km-lite-plain-write.sh`)
  now **SKIP with a reason + exit 0** when the dispatcher is absent (same
  `SKIP:` convention `scenario-1` already used for a missing sample-vault) —
  so CI is honest, not red, and not falsely green.

## Supported path instead

Use thiscode through **Claude Code** (or any LLM agent that reads `SKILL.md`):

- Search: `/search "<query>"` (4-Tier fallback) — `skills/search/SKILL.md`
- KM ingest: `/thiscode:km` / `/knowledge-manager-lite` — `skills/knowledge-manager-lite/SKILL.md`

## How to un-defer (future)

To make the Hermes programmatic path real, add executable dispatchers at the
two paths above that implement the 4-Tier search / km-lite extract contracts
(`contracts/search-fallback-4tier.md`, `contracts/km-*.md`). Once present, the
handlers' `*.exists()` guard automatically resumes the normal `_run(...)` path
and the four tests stop skipping — no further code change required.
