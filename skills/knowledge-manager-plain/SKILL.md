# knowledge-manager-plain

> Implements Mode I from `contracts/km-mode-spec.md`. Plain variant per `contracts/km-variant-matrix.md` (no AskUserQuestion).

## Trigger
- $CLAUDE_DISCODE_HEADLESS=1 + any KM Mode I request
- `/thiscode:km --variant plain ...`

## Workflow

1. Read `~/.thiscode-config` for vault_root. If missing, write to `$HOME/Inbox/` with notice.
2. Extract (URL/file/text) — same as km-lite Step 2.
3. Generate frontmatter — same as km-lite Step 3, but auto-derive tags from title only (no AskUserQuestion).
4. Determine sub-folder: always `Inbox/`.
5. Write via `Write` tool only (no Obsidian CLI/MCP — even if present, skip for determinism).
6. Print stored path.

## Why no Obsidian even when present
Plain variant guarantees byte-identical output regardless of environment — important for batch ingestion and headless CI use.
