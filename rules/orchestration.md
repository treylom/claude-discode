# Rule: multi-agent orchestration

Trigger: delegating to / waiting on another bot, convening a meeting,
asserting another bot's identity or health, or coordinating multiple agents.

## 1. Bot identity = verify, never assume
- A bot's identity SoT is the persona injected at session start for **its own**
  `<bot>` (derived from its state dir / `~/.../discord-<bot>`), plus its own
  working-directory context file.
- **Chain-load guard**: agent runtimes load every context file from cwd up to
  the repo root. If a shared/root context file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` /
  `GEMINI.md`) also doubles as one specific bot's WD meta ("I am X"), every
  other bot whose WD sits under that root chain-loads it and can absorb that
  identity. Put an **identity guard at the very top** of any such file: "this
  identity block applies only when `<bot>` == X; otherwise ignore it — your
  identity is your own injected persona + your own WD context." A bot speaking
  in another bot's voice / self-referring as another bot = this guard missing.
- The orchestrator **verifies** a teammate's session/identity/health (live
  check, source-fact) before delegating or waiting. "It's probably working" by
  assumption, then waiting, is dereliction.

## 2. Drive, don't idle (collaboration-boundary distinction)
- Teammate is the gate but idle/blocked → orchestrator actively re-engages:
  supply an executable input (e.g. collect the *data* yourself so the
  teammate's judgement step is unblocked), run non-gating tracks in parallel.
- Distinguish: **blocked on a user decision** → summarize, report, stop (no
  polling). **Teammate idle / oversight** → not a stop; drive and verify. Do
  not conflate the two into passive waiting.

## 3. Meeting facilitation (no solo lock)
- Convener does not force its own frame; adopt each bot's domain prep frame as
  that domain's SoT, register frames separately, keep your draft as one input.
- Lock only after: gate teammate's output → meeting consensus → independent
  review → second-track review → maintainer sign-off. No single step skipped.

▶ Fill in: how `<bot>` is derived in your setup; your identity-guard location;
your independent-review + second-track reviewers; your maintainer sign-off path.
